NOW STREAMING ON:
"Few things in life are certain besides death, taxes, and maybe the never-ending task that is doing laundry. At least that’s where the characters in writer/directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, new film “Everything Everywhere All at Once” find themselves initially. That is, until they take an emotional, philosophical, and deeply weird trip through the looking glass into the multiverse and discover metaphysical wisdom along the way. "
"In this love letter to genre cinema, Michelle Yeoh gives a virtuoso performance as Evelyn Wang, a weary owner of a laundromat under IRS audit. We first meet her enjoying a happy moment with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). We see their smiling faces reflected in a mirror on their living room wall. As the camera literally zooms through the mirror, Evelyn’s smile fades, now seated at a table awash with business receipts. She’s preparing for a meeting with an auditor while simultaneously trying to cook food for a Chinese New Year party that will live up to the high standards of her visiting father Gong Gong (James Hong, wiley as ever). "
"On top of juggling her father’s visit and the tax audit, Evelyn’s sullen daughter Joy wants to bring her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel) to the party and her husband wants to talk about the state of their marriage. Just as Evelyn begins to feel overwhelmed by everything happening in her life she’s visited by another version of Waymond from what he calls the Alpha verse. Here humans have learned to “verse jump” and are threatened by an omniverse agent of chaos known as Jobu Tupaki. Soon, Evelyn is thrust into a universe-hopping adventure that has her questioning everything she thought she knew about her life, her failures, and her love for her family. "
"Most of the action is set in an IRS office building in Simi Valley (which, as a Californian, had me in stitches), where Evelyn must battle IRS agent Diedre (Jamie Lee Curtis, having the time of her life), a troop of security guards, and possibly everyone else she’s ever met. Production designer Jason Kisvarday crafts a seemingly endless cubicle-filled office where everything from the blade of a paper trimmer to a butt plug shaped auditor of the year awards become fair game in a battle to save the universe. "
"Editor Paul Rogers' breakneck pace matches the script’s frenetic dialogue, with layers of universes simultaneously folding into each other while also propelling Evelyn’s internal journey. Match cuts seamlessly connect the universes together, while playful cuts help emphasize the humor at the heart of the film. "
"Born from choices both made and not made, each universe has a distinct look and feel, with winking film references ranging from “The Matrix” to “The Fall” to “2001: A Space Odyssey” to “In The Mood For Love” to “Ratatouille.” Even Michelle Yeoh’s own legacy finds its way into the film with loving callbacks to her Hong Kong action film days and the wuxia classic “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” The fight sequences, choreographed by Andy and Brian Le, have a balletic beauty to them, wisely shot by cinematographer Larkin Seiple in wide shots allowing whole bodies to fill the frame."
"Yeoh is the anchor of the film, given a role that showcases her wide range of talents, from her fine martial art skills to her superb comic timing to her ability to excavate endless depths of rich human emotion often just from a glance or a reaction. She is a movie star and this is a movie that knows it. Watching her shine so bright and clearly having a ball brought tears to my eyes more than once.  "
"Just as Evelyn taps into Yeoh’s iconography, facets of Waymond can be found throughout Quan’s unique career. The comic timing from his childhood roles as Data in “The Goonies” and Short Round in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” echoes in Evelyn’s nebbish husband. His work as a fight coordinator shows through in Alpha’s slick action hero capable of using a fanny pack to take out a group of attackers. Even his time as an assistant director to Wong Kar Wai on “2046” can be found in the universe where he plays the debonair one who got away. Quan tackles these variations with aplomb, bringing pathos to each and serving as a gentle reminder that there's strength in kindness. "
"As Evelyn and Waymond’s relationship ebbs and flows in iterations through the multiverses, it’s their daughter Joy who proves to be the lynchpin. In a true breakout performance from Stephanie Hsu, Joy represents a growing generational divide. Joy carries the weight of Evelyn’s fractured relationship with her grandfather and the disappointments of an American dream unattained. Her queerness as foreign to her mother as the country was when she herself first arrived. Her aimlessness a greater disappointment because of all that Eveyln sacrificed for her to have more options in life than she did. This pressure manifests in a rebellion so great it stretches beyond the multiverses into a realm where a giant everything bagel looms like a black hole ready to suck everyone into the void. "
"If the void arises from the compounding of generational trauma, the Daniels posit that it can be reversed through the unconditional love passed down through those same generations, if we choose compassion and understanding over judgment and rejection. Chaos reigns and life may only ever make sense in fleeting moments, but it’s those moments we should cherish. Moments of love and camaraderie. Sometimes they happen over time. Sometimes they happen all at once. "
This review was filed from the premiere at the SXSW Film Festival. The film opens on March 25th.
"Marya E. Gates is a freelance film and culture writer based in Los Angeles and Chicago. She studied Comparative Literature at U.C. Berkeley, and also has an overpriced and underused MFA in Film Production. Other bylines include Moviefone, The Playlist, Crooked Marquee, Nerdist, and Vulture. "
"Rated R for some violence, sexual material and language."

"These days, everyone wants a multiverse movie – Marvel, DC, and now the guys who made Swiss Army Man. If nothing else, Everything Everywhere All at Once shows that it can be done without committing a nine-figure sum to the production budget. That’s because, although it’s primarily an action movie with fantasy pretentions, the latest feature from “Daniels” (the moniker for Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert) is, at its heart, about the bond between mothers and daughters with all the resentment, rivalry, and love that it entails."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once has been rightfully praised in many corners for its wit and inventiveness. Both are present. Although Kwan & Scheinert have something serious to say, they have a lot of fun doing it. There are some laugh-aloud moments but not much tension – multiverse stories, where the stakes are theoretically high, tend not to be very suspenseful because it’s impossible for the human mind to grasp the cosmic enormities of the scope, regardless of how the filmmakers attempt to dumb it down. The movie maintains its tongue-in-cheek approach until it comes time to plumb the emotional core. Along the way, we see unorthodox things like a man consuming lip balm, philosophizing rocks, a woman using a leashed dog as a weapon, anal plugs as a means to enhance martial arts capabilities, and people with hot dogs for fingers. Oh, and don’t forget the puppet-master raccoons. (Davy Crockett never had it like this.)"
"One problem the directors are unable to conquer is how to corral the vastness of the multiverse. There’s too much repetition as they try to show how the temporal butterfly effect impacts the characters. As a result, while the movie has tremendous momentum for the first 45 minutes, there’s a lengthy lull of nearly an hour where replication is a primary characteristic. Everything Everywhere All at Once is probably a half-hour too long and there are times past the midpoint when all the cleverness starts to run thin. These problems are straightened out for the climax – the movie “sticks” the landing."
"The narrative starts by introducing us to the dysfunctional Wang family: wife Eveyln (Michelle Yeoh), a traditional Chinese woman with Type A tendencies; daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), a lesbian who has grown tired of her mother’s constant criticism; and husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), a timid man who wants a divorce. Also in the mix is Eveyln’s father, Gong Gon (James Hong), who lives with the family but whose mind is so addled that he isn’t the imposing man he once was. The Wangs run a laundromat that’s currently being audited by the IRS and things start getting weird when they pay a visit for a talk with auditor Dierdre Beaubeirdra (Jamie Lee Curtis). That’s when Waymond starts acting strange, making odd pronouncements and encouraging Eveyln to do things that don’t make any sense. When she does, all hell breaks loose and she soon learns that the multiverse is under threat from a powerful entity called Jobu Tupaki, whose powers to control chaos are undermining countless universes. Jobu Tupaki is hunting down Evelyns everywhere for a reason that ultimately becomes apparent. In order to save the multiverse, Eveyln must let go of the ordered structure of her mundane life and become the hero whose promise is evident in the other Evelyns across the multiverse."
"Kwan & Scheinert are not scientists, but then neither are most of the storytellers venturing into the minefield of multiverse narratives. The movie obfuscates its mammoth plot holes by doing some very silly things (the MacGuffin is a giant bagel) and putting the focus on martial arts fights and Michelle Yeoh’s multifaceted performance. The martial arts sequences aren’t the best or the most kinetic we’ve seen but they are among the most unusual. Although body doubles were used for some scenes, Yeoh (age 59 at the time of filming) continues to show the poise and elegance that earned her a loyal following during the ‘80s (when she went by the name of “Michelle Khan”) and the ’90s (when she headlined Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with Chow-Yun Fat). The astoundingly prolific James Hong (he has hundreds of credits dating back to the ‘50s) has one of his best live-action appearances since Big Trouble in Little China. Jamie Lee Curtis is unrecognizable with or without the hot dog fingers."
"Multiverse stories are never as simple as they seem to be, primarily because the underlying concepts are rarely explored with any rigor. They are plot devices that allow for Groundhog Day­-like scenarios to play out. Everything Everywhere All at Once offers a devil-may-care approach and a deliciously wicked sense of humor, a top-flight performance from Michelle Yeoh, and an emotionally true central theme, all of which are sufficient to trump any multiverse-related problems. Although it runs too long, it’s nevertheless an enjoyable and satisfying romp through the lives of one woman who makes “being the worst of her selves” an asset."

" Michelle Yeoh channels multidimensional skills to grapple with her family’s exploding identities in the Daniels’ hyper-inventive, goofily radical pop fantasia."
12 May 2022
By Ben Walters
"News, reviews and archive features every Friday, and information about our latest magazine once a month."
► Everything Everywhere All At Once is in UK cinemas from 13 May.
"In many on-screen adventure stories, everyday experience is revealed to be a miasma concealing a hostile world whose challenges to life and wellbeing, once recognised, can be confronted and overcome. Such tales make a strong binary claim about existence: in The Matrix (1999), for instance, the choice is between a red pill and a blue pill, representing the real and the unreal. Recently, there’s been an increase in adventure stories that invite discrimination not between two universes but across many. Multiverses now structure the Marvel and DC superhero sagas, bingeable streaming series such as Dark and Russian Doll and plenty more."
"In their foregrounding of several versions of the same character, or even several personae occupying the same body, they offer a kind of pop anti-essentialism. Under their radically questionable conditions, the hero’s challenge shifts: less about overcoming false consciousness to defeat evil, more about grappling with fathomless contingency to stay in one piece and make it through the day. In this sense, navigating the multiverse is a bit like being middle-aged."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is built around this understanding. Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) is in trouble: her obstreperous father (James Hong) is visiting from China; her marriage to cheerful, ineffectual Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) is on the rocks; their unhappy daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) perplexes Evelyn’s notions of sexuality and culture; and the family laundromat faces a fateful audit from tax inspector Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis). Then Evelyn is saddled with a multidimensional mission, charged by a secret-agent version of Waymond with accessing skills from various alternate versions of herself (teppanyaki chef, kung-fu-singer-movie-star, inanimate object) to neutralise Jobu Tupaki, a version of Joy whose chaotic energy threatens to end existence."
"The great pleasures of Everything Everywhere come from the dazzlingly bizarre imagination with which the writer-director team Daniels – aka Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert – bring this set-up to life. (Their previous film, Swiss Army Man, also showed serious commitment to a weird idea.) The alternative worlds here range from not-so-different to properly batshit and the embrace of absurdity is part of the cosmology’s “verse-jumping” methodology. It’s a wild tonal ride, from cartoonish ultraviolence to plaintive whimsy: think James Cameron at Dunder Mifflin, Tex Avery on TikTok or Gaspar Noé in Ann Summers, with dashes of Wachowski, Kubrick, Pixar, Wong Kar-Wai and Charlie Kaufman too. The cast are on point amid the cacophony, Hong and Curtis showing particular gusto."
"For all the goofily surprising, high-octane action, this is at heart a character piece; call it poignant maximalism. Evelyn’s family’s life is ordinarily cluttered, demanding and disappointing, fraught with intergenerational miscommunication, resentment, guilt, fear, failure and regret. Fantasy writes large feelings that come with the territory: I want her dead; if he carries on like this it will be the end of us; are you for real right now?"
"Yeoh and Hsu’s rich dynamic is the film’s core. Their characters aren’t always likeable – frazzled and crabby, withholding and uncertain – but they hold sympathy just by doing their damn best. Jobu Tupaki is stupendously unstable, capable of transforming her looks, abilities and vibe within a scene or even a shot, from club-kid neons to golf pastels, Tudor ruffs to Elvis jumpsuit. She conveys both the child’s painful search for identity and meaning and the parent’s bewildered anxiety around loss of control and cultural transformation. Is change entropy, entropy death?"
"Appropriately, the multiverse concept works on many levels. There are nods at the fragmentary effects of side-hustle labour practices, living with ADHD and exploring online rabbit-holes. There’s focus too on the shifts between thought-worlds experienced by code-switching, polyglot migrant people. Different languages structure and create different modes of being; and getting lost in translation might also mean inadvertently coining a delightful new idea."
"The reveries and regrets of middle age loom large, in terms of both contemplation of roads not taken and recognition of experience and satisfaction as matters of perspective: one person’s disaster zone might be another’s oasis. Yeoh’s performance shows with peculiar power the effort required to remain anchored in one reality when so many others demand one’s inevitably insufficient attention. Is it possible to chart a course of empathetic present-mindedness between impossible perfectionism and entropic ennui? The film suggests the effort is worthwhile but also recognises the impulse to refuse and withdraw. Life, like the multiverse, and Everything Everywhere All At Once, is a lot."
"Paul Schrader holds court in the latest S&S.

Don’t Order the Everything Bagel
"If you’re not yet ready for the Metaverse or don’t know what it means, the harassed Simi Valley laundromat owner who’s the star of indie production company A24’s breakthrough hit, “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” will help you get there. And she’ll throw some existentialism into the mix."
"Facing their business's IRS audit are the Wang family, left to right, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), and Grandpa Gong Gong (James Hong)."
"Michele Yeoh is marvelous as Evelyn, the job-focused, multi-tasking, “I’m-more-competent-than-you-are” superhero of this mind-bending sci-fi story. Within minutes of the film’s opening, she’s fitted with earphones, whisked into a janitor’s closet, and introduced to other universes—in fact, many other universes, since the number is infinite. She’s also taught the mechanics of “verse-jumping,” which can involve any action from peeing one’s pants to eating ChapStick."
"Above, Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, amid piles of receipts for her laundromat."
The first 45 minutes may leave all but the most experienced virtual reality gamer reeling and confused.
"The first 45 minutes may leave all but the most experienced virtual reality gamer reeling and confused. Then the human story begins to unfold, in many universes; the universes repeat, bringing some order to the seemingly chaotic Metaverse. Evelyn’s sampling in the multiple universes of lives she could have led reflects the contemporary desire to escape from the tedium and ordinariness of daily existence—through extreme sports, TikTok, horror films, video games, conspiracy theories and, yes, the Metaverse."
Paralleling Evelyn’s mid-life crisis is her daughter Joy’s adolescent angst.
"“Everything…” upends several movie traditions. For one, our “hero” is a 60-year-old Asian laundromat owner. Another is that it’s a mother-daughter story, not the more typical tale of father and son. Paralleling Evelyn’s mid-life crisis is her daughter Joy’s adolescent angst, portrayed by Stephanie Hsu with emotional nuance. In another universe (or other universes), Joy is also the story’s villain, Jobu Tupaki (again, a captivating Hsu)."
"Joy/Jobu and Evelyn effectively embody the existential crisis; if everything matters, then nothing matters. If all life has the same valence, then what is the value of any particular way of being? A movie star is a kung-fu expert is a sushi chef is a rock (literally) is a laundromat owner. If it’s all the same, why not escape into the black hole (look for the “everything bagel”)? Why not suicide?"
"Jamie Lee Curtis, right, is the"
 IRS auditor. The only white person
" among the stars, she seems like"
 a paper doll from another set.
"In her superhero role, Evelyn takes on all the enemy’s men, as well as one woman, a wonderfully comedic Jamie Lee Curtis as IRS auditor Deirdre (David Foster Wallace would have appreciated the banality of the IRS Service Center setting). The martial arts moves of Evelyn, and those of her adversaries, are an integral part of the story’s Metaverse. Every conceivable object is put to use—a fanny pack, pet dog, cookie sheet and drumstick, in addition to the traditional ones. Yeoh incredibly (at age 60 she does most of her own stunt work) reprises her role in “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (2000). Curtis, as the only white person among the stars, seems like a paper doll from another set. Compared to the fascinating faces and physical talents of the Asians who people the film, Curtis is really white, large, ungainly, and very funny."
"Above center, Michelle Yeoh who at age 60 does most of her own stunt work."
"The superhero-takes-on-all-comers theme is entertaining but excessive. Too many universes and too many martial arts battles can wear down the viewer rather than enhance the narrative. Does one need “Raccacoonie” (rhymes with “Ratatouille”)? Or one more skirmish with the IRS agents? Still, VRers may delight in the multiplicity. Co-writers and directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (sometimes known as the “Daniels”) take their TV and music video experience to a new level. With a not-so-large $25 million budget, they did the VFX themselves with friends, none of whom had been schooled in it."
"Echoes of George Bailey in 1946’s “It’s a Wonderful Life."""
"The narrative that’s burdened by too many fights is a familiar one, told freshly. As Evelyn relives her life’s alternative pasts, and her real past, she comes to appreciate who she is in the present, and the value of those around her, especially her daughter and long-suffering husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan)—he too has his Alpha-verse manly side. To Evelyn’s scorn, Waymond brings cookies to the IRS agent, and tells his wife, “Even though you have broken my heart yet again, I wanted to say, in another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you.” Evelyn relives her regret and transcends it, and in the process transcends her doubts about her lot in life, about the decisions she has made. Echoes of George Bailey in 1946’s “It’s a Wonderful Life”; George’s angel Clarence is Evelyn’s Metaverse."
"Above, the Wangs in their Simi Valley laundromat."
"Yeoh, Quan, Hsu, Curtis, and James Hong (as Grandpa Gong Gong) give moving performances that rise above the kung fu theatrics and create the heart—a touch of Hollywood—within this remarkable story."

DIRECTED BY: Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert)
"FEATURING: Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis, James Hong"
"PLOT: Evelyn Wang is barely keeping it together, running a business and raising a family while the threat of an IRS audit hangs over her head; as if that wasn’t enough stress, just before a last-chance appointment with her stern auditor, a visitor from a parallel universe tells her the fate of the multiverse lies in her hands."
""
"WHY IT MIGHT JOIN THE APOCRYPHA: Based on the trailer, I had originally assumed this was going to be Daniels’ mainstream popcorn movie: a sci-fi/action/comedy not likely to be significantly weirder than The Matrix or the latest Marvel Phase 4 offering. And while there were plenty of wisecracks, kung fu free -for-alls, sentimentality, and CGI frippery, the makers of Swiss Army Man  snuck enough genuine weirdness and unpredictability into the formula that, as the credits rolled, a young theater patron was moved to loudly announce “bizarre is the only word that describes that.”"
"COMMENTS: Evelyn is a hot mess: a hot mess in a quiet, middle-aged matron kind of way, but a hot mess nevertheless. Harried and constantly distracted, she vainly tries to balance running her laundry business with an overextended social life. She also has to deal with the family members constantly vying for her attention: neglected husband Waymond, lesbian daughter Joy and her new girlfriend, and disapproving, ailing father Gong Gong. It’s no wonder that Evelyn’s 1040 was selected for audit, and that she’s having enough trouble filling out the forms correctly and collecting the proper receipts and documentation that the business is in danger. And so it’s also little surprise that, when told by an interdimensional emissary that the fate of the entire multiverse depends on her, her response is an exasperated “Very busy today, no time to help you.”"
"But of course, help she reluctantly does. After the setup, the movie reveals its relatively complicated mechanics about infinite universes that branch off at individual’s decision points (i.e., marry Waymond or don’t marry Waymond creates a new universe, as does eating eggs for breakfast instead of noodles), all leading to a network of bubble universes that are visualized as nodes on a smartphone app. A helpful avatar of her husband from the “Alpha” universe explains the evil force threatening all existence (which involves a “bagel of everything”) and how Evelyn can access the skills and knowledge of versions of herself from parallel universes to counter it. So she does, with both badass successes and wacky failures along the way."
"With its focus on branching realities, the Canonically Weird movie Everything Everywhere all at Once most resembles is Mr. Nobody (2009) rather than Swiss Army Man. In fact, it’s Nobody to the nth degree: where Jaco Van Dormael‘s cult classic confined itself to three main alternate histories (with notable detours like the argyle universe), Everything attempts to live up to its title with dozens upon dozens of alternate realities, from simple ones where Evelyn is a martial arts expert or a movie star to bizarre worlds where she’s a piñata, a sentient rock, or (the audience’s favorite) a lesbian in a universe where everyone has hot dog fingers. Adding to the eccentricity, the Daniels posit that it’s necessary to seed a jump to a new universe by performing an unpredictable action like eating an entire tube of ChapStick or—in another audience favorite scene—finding an unconventional use for a suggestively shaped IRS auditor’s award."
"The script requires almost every actor to play multiple roles, and the ensemble acting is about as good as it gets. Everyone shines, although naturally it’s Yeoh who holds it all together with a performance that recalls (and references) her Hong Kong roots in wuxia films, as well as her recent turn to comedy with Crazy Rich Asians. And a special kudos have to be given to 93-year-old James Hong, for whom this would be an excellent cherry on the top of an incredible 450-role career (except that he still has more films coming out, and may be trying to hit 500 credits before he passes the century mark)."
"Ultimately, all the apocalyptic furor relates to events in Evelyn’s real universe—uh, the universe we started in, that is. My only slight reservation is with the ending, which gets a bit sappy in delivering its honorably intended “love yourself, faults and all” message. On the other hand, not everyone is a black-hearted cynic like me, and most audience members seemed as moved by the film’s pathos as they were invigorated by its action and amused by its comedy. In the end, this impressive feature comes pretty close to delivering Everything, with bizarre and imaginative conceits delivered at a hyper pace that does make it sometimes seem like they’re happening All at Once. Everything Everywhere all at Once is recommended for everyone everywhere as soon as you can."
WHAT THE CRITICS SAY:
"“…an explosion of creative weirdness that is equal parts exhilarating and overwhelming…  It’s ground-breaking because it allows a new perspective, but it’s also just blatantly weird. It’s not glossy or careful; the film is an onslaught of visual and thematic ideas… In an era of sequels and remakes, something this outside the box is a welcome alternate reality.”–Emily Zemler, Observer (contemporaneous)"
 
"I’m confident this will make the Apocrypha. In that event, it will be the only Apocrypha movie I’ve seen in a theater."
This has to be in the Apocrypha! One of the only films that actually made me get out of my room and go to a local theater!
"Just came back from seeing it on the big screen. Yes, it needs to be to be added the Apocrypha."
"My dissenting opinion is that this film is tedious, overlong, and overly conventional. Yes it’s also creative."
"I wouldn’t call it conventional. Frankly, as an Asian person, I wish I liked the movie more but it must go down in history as the craziest film nominated for Best Picture (plus 10 other Oscars). It’s a one of a kind experience.. The five stars aRe great And yes, welcome back, Mr Quan. Huge respect and admiration, but I wished I had more love for it."

"It took me 30 minutes to find the exact way to describe the amazing insanity I have been through in those 141 minutes. So I am going to try and there must be more than a zillion interpretations to this story, so don’t come at me if mine doesn’t sit with yours. Ever thought of how life would be in an alternate reality? What if there are more of us living the best/worst of us? Even interesting, what if we could teleport? Would that make us happy or it is now and the love we have with us right here enough to not delve into the multiverse?"
"Writer-director duo Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert take all these questions in their second film and make a product so absurd that it feels brainless but ends up being the smartest. But the journey to prove smartness is so crazy that smart isn’t the word that pops up in your mind until the end. In their first film where farting was a legitimate superpower (Swiss Army Man, starring Paul Dano & Daniel Radcliffe), the filmmakers teased the concept of Everything Everywhere All At Once, and in their second they take it ahead."
"Of course, there is a multiverse, and traveling through it. Channels and gates to travel through the multiverse, dents and cracks created and the outcome of the cracks caused and bizarre ways to mend them. But at the heart of it, Dan and Daniel both shape a story about bonds and love and adulation. In Evelyn, they shape a woman who not just belongs to an oppressed immigrated community amid the white folks, but has also oppressed her inner self that wants to fly. She is woman who wants the best for her family, but is also conservative about her daughter being gay. She has tried her hands at being a writer, teacher, singer and many things but possibly failed."
"So when such a woman who also has a husband who is over-optimistic with the scarcity-prone life, is given a chance to live herself from the alternate universes, what does she learn? The script that finds solace is chaos and absurdity, never really deviates from its core even when it looks like it does. It is about Evelyn understanding that nowhere in this gigantic space is a version of her living without a problem. The writing even pitches her against her own daughter and further extends to the fact about how it is love that conquers even the multiverse."
"There is a universe where people have hotdogs as fingers, or one where people are legit dolls, or crayon sketches. There is even one where they are rocks and they talk to each other. Dan and Daniel seem to have gone into the most bizarre corners of their heart and mind to tell the simplest of the tale in the most complex of the manner without make it a circus."
"There are several Easter eggs and homages throughout the film. The funniest and the cutest is to Ratatouille. Decode some more for yourself and let me know in the comments. Make sure you listen to the music carefully too. Also, won’t ignore, the climax action sequence feels a bit stretched."
